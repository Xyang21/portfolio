        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        <p>
           As a highly dedicated and ambitious student, I am pursuing a Bachelor degree in Information Technology at the Model Institute of Technology, Kathmandu. My academic base is strong, coupled with hands-on experiences with things I study; I like to add creative problem-solving skills in facing real-life challenges.

I am keen on innovation, product design, and the technical implementation of solutions that matter and have an impact. I want to continue developing with purpose-driven projects where I can make positive contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside my studies, I have actively engaged in entrepreneurship and tech projects—founding a local handicraft goods marketplace and working in supply chain. These experiences have sharpened my leadership, teamwork, and technical abilities.
